- Results:

    - A p-value of 0.0 evidence against the null hypothesis that the data follows a normal distribution.

- Results:
    - p-value: 1.4746533536159162e-10
- Interpretation: 
    - The extremely low p-value from the Mann-Whitney test indicates a significant difference between the prices of superhosts and non-superhosts. 
    - This suggests that the prices in these two groups are not only different, but that this difference is statistically significant, implying that the superhost status has a meaningful impact on pricing strategies in the Airbnb market.

Increasing number of superhosts is directly related to higher prices. Hence, the superhost status has a meaningful impact on pricing strategies in the Airbnb market.
